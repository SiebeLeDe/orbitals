## Cleaned files

The files in this "rkfs" have been "cleaned", meaning the following sections have been deleted from the original files:

- Core
- SCF
- ZlmFit_ActiveFrag
- ZlmFit_Ftyp 1
- ZlmFit_Ftyp 2
- ZlmFit_Ort
- ZlmFit_SumFrg

## Consequences

The consequences of this cleaning are that the files are not directly usable for the amsview and amsreport programs. Plotting the orbitals is therefore not possible anymore.
