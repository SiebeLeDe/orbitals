## Introduction

Analyzing molecular orbital (MO) diagrams and plotting these orbitals can be a tedious task and may require many hours spent replotting orbitals to your liking. This can be made much more efficient by having a python interface to automate visualization, making it much more enjoyable and clearer to analyze the results of your calculations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this package is to provide a python interface to plot the results of AMS ADF calculations. The package is written in python and uses the [plams](https://www.scm.com/doc/plams/index.html) package to interface with the AMS software. The package is tested with AMS2023.204.

## Installation

There are several ways to install the python package:

- [x] Locally: first clone the github page and move to the directory. Then install it locally in your python environment with
``pip install -e .``

- [x] PyPI: ``pip install orbitalster``

The required python environment is taken care of by the package manager. Note that you should have a working python environment with the required dependencies installed. See the [requirements file](requirements.txt) for a list of dependencies. I recommend using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage your python environment.

Furthermore, please make sure that you have the AMS software installed and that the amsview and amsreport programs are available in your path. The package is tested with AMS2023.204.

## Example

Tutorials covering key functionality can be found in the [example folder](scripts). Several scripts are available to show how the package works.

1. The [first script](scripts/densf_example.py) illustrates how to obtain volume files from .t21 result files from the AMS ADF engine. The .t21 are read in, and the voluma maps are generated by a plams.DensfJob implementation. Presets are made for easy-accessible settings.

2. The [second script](scripts/main.py) illustrates how to turn the volume maps (e.g., .t41, .vtk files) into images. It uses the amsview or amsreport program which are part of AMS.
